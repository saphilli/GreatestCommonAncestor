# LowestCommonAncestor
Implementation of Binary Tree in Swift along with a function to find the lowest common ancestor between two nodes of the tree (exercise to learn Swift) 

NOTE: For the second LowestCommonAncestor Assignment, I continued from the first project that I used for the first assignment. The binary tree class files and tests are still present alongside the files and tests for the DAG. 

Key Files containting code of interest
Assignment 1
- LowestCommonAncestor/LowestCommonAncestor/BinaryTree.swift
- LowestCommonAncestor/LowestCommonAncestorTests/LowestCommonAncestorTests.swift

Assignment 2
- LowestCommonAncestor/LowestCommonAncestor/Vertex.swift
- LowestCommonAncestor/LowestCommonAncestor/Queue.swift
- LowestCommonAncestor/LowestCommonAncestor/Edge.swift
- LowestCommonAncestor/LowestCommonAncestor/Graph.swift
- LowestCommonAncestor/LowestCommonAncestor/LowestCommonAncestorTests.swift

(ignore the code in the .playground file, used this for learning basic syntax of the language, etc)
